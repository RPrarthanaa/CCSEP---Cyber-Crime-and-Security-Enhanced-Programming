# Assignment 

Developed an image gallery web application to demonstrate behaviour of path traversal attacks 

## Features:
- [ ] Images loaded dynamically via PHP based on user input
- [ ] Contains a vulnerable file that allows directory traversal
- [ ] Contains secure version to demonstrate vulnerability mitigation
